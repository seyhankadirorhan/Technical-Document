        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <li>general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about
            JavaScript.</li>

        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
            resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
            syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
            JavaScript.</p> <br>
        <p> In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
            on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
            object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
            special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
            digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
            characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
