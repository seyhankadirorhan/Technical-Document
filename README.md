Technical Documentation Project

Overview

This project is a simple technical documentation webpage built using HTML and CSS. The page is styled to provide a clean, accessible layout and serves as an example for structuring and styling documentation with fixed navigation and responsive design principles.

Features

1. Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fixed on the left side of the page and includes links to various sections of the documentation.

It features:

A header titled "Documentation".

Links to sections: Introduction, What You Should Already Know, JavaScript and Java, Hello World, and Variables.

Links are styled with padding and a hover effect for ease of use.

2. Main Content

Each section contains:

A header that identifies the section title.

Informative content describing the section topic.

Code examples using the <code> tag for better readability.

Lists (<li>) to outline key points.

3. Styling

The page is styled with an external CSS file (tech.css).

The CSS implements:

A fixed navigation bar with a width of 10vw and a minimum width of 300px.

Distinct sections that are easily readable and well-spaced.

Responsive design using a media query for tablet devices.
